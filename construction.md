* This section presents why and how I build this website.

# Why I set up my website and blog by jekyll?
Thanks to the service of [github](https://github.com/), I am able to manage the information and data I want to share with the world on my laptop and personal clouds. Managing the articles on a internet service is like a farmer grows the plants on a rented field. The layout of my works have to follow the default settings of the service. I can build my website and blog as what I want by customize the templete in [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This gives me the motivation to contribute writings to the internet.

# Why I use steve-ngvb theme?
Jekyll bloggers around the world have contributed their themes to [Jekyll Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/). [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/), the faculty of Clemson University, released his theme [steve-ngvb](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/svm-ngvb/). This theme has the templates of blog posts and static web page. It matches my need to assign my works to the category I have defined. 

# Why I write article and blog by Rstudio?
In the date I found the R packages to compose web page and journal article, I have the idea manage my websit and blog in [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/) contributed a R project integrated jekyll components on his [github repo](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll). One year later, [Brendan Rocks](https://brendanrocks.com/) build a R pacakge `brocks` to help bloggers build a blog post in R. My blog posts having R codes and statitic works will be made up in this way. With the increase of my knowledge about jekyll and Rmarkdown, I will release a jekyll theme and a R package which help more people be used to these tools in fewer steps than me.
