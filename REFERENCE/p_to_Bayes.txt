There are some reference I have to collect and summary before I write this post. I appear to find why the table to explain "hypothesis testing" and "signal detection theory" is unable to break the misunderstanding of p value. Here are the references I will cite and comment in this post.

[Misinterpretations and misuses of p-values][1] by Martha K. Smith
[Misunderstandings Involving Conditional Probabilities][2] by Martha K. Smith
[Table of Bayesian interpretation][3] from wiki page
