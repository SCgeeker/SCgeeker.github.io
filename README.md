Steve's No-Good-Very-Bad Jekyll Theme
=====================================

This is Jekyll theme created by Steve Miller, which is basically [Joel Glovier](http://joelglovier.com/)'s `jekyll-new` theme smashed with [Alex King](http://www.alexking.org)'s [Favepersonal](https://crowdfavorite.com/favepersonal/) theme for Wordpress. Steve used Favepersonal for his Wordpress site before abandoning it. User can see Steve's site at [svmiller.github.io](http://svmiller.github.io).

Much of what is contained in here is derivative of those two works. That said, do observe the `embedpdf.html` and `image.html` files in the `_includes` directory. `embedpdf.html` uses Google Docs to allow for embedding of PDF files hosted on Dropbox. `image.html` provides fancier images than what is standard for Markdown. An example use of `embedpdf.html` can be observed in the `cv.md` file. An example use of `image.html` can be observed in the `about.md` file.

Steve-ngvb uses data-driven navigation, which user can see in the `menu.yml` file in the `_data` directory. There's also a `nav.html` file in the `_includes` directory with modified `header.html`.

Mobile support is clearly functional, though some white-spacing could be improved. Feel free to offer improvements if user has the idea.

`css` and `_sass` directories also functional, if a bit cluttered. Do observe new colors I created for `$clemson-orange` and `$clemson-purple` in `css/main.scss`.

Feel free to contact the theme author at svmille@clemson.edu. Send along some cheers too if you find it useful.
