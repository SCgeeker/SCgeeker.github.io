# Lex Bouter examines sjoemelwetenschap : "People sometimes vain and greedy '

A breakthrough in the fight against cancer , the effects of climate change, the risk of violent games ... NWO 's scientists ask how often they make their research more exciting sound than it is.


Research Financier NWO has allocated five million euros for the new research "Promoting Responsible Research Practices . This NWO wants five-year examine the practice of scientific research. A large national survey among scientists associated with it.


The project is still in its infancy, stressed Lex Bouter , former rector of the University and now professor of methodology and integrity. He is one of the driving forces behind the new research.


But he wants to lift a corner of the veil. "We want to ask colleagues from universities, hospitals and research how they look in the science against various forms of undesirable behavior . they cut themselves sometimes make a turn to make their research more spectacular and more positive ? And why do they do that? "

### Are all scientists are tempted to present their research better than it is ?

Most will sometimes tend to feel to give it a twist , to be a bit selective in their view, and especially to report that confirms their preconceptions . That is understandable. The trick of science is precisely to resist that tendency . We have long thought that outright fraud was the biggest problem of science: falsifying data , as did Diederik Stapel. However, the cutting off of bends occurs much more frequently. That's really important. We do not want thugs in prison , we want to improve the research practice. 

### What do you mean by " cutting corners "?

It can be anything. You can do endless analyzes and report only the results that confirm your own prejudice. In research into new medicines can control the amount comparator suboptimal , so that the new drug will win easily . Or you can make mention yourself as an author in an article that you do not actually have written. Since tell many anecdotes about candidates . Sometimes deliver large businesses data, analysis and articles and then ask them a big shot if he did not want to be authored , if necessary fee. People are sometimes vain and greedy.

### Are you there or approached once before when you took another epidemiological study ?

" No, I myself did not study for it was eligible . I know this all out stories from colleagues. "

### Have you yourself ever searched the gray area ?

" All scientists are exposed to temptation , I am no exception . The problem is that you 're not always aware of. Sometimes you see things in a very colored light. Take away is the art of science. Especially if you 're the discussion section , there will sometimes sentences from the text editor roles that you think after some reflection : this is actually supported by my research ? "

### Can you do good research to do here? Cheaters will never fill honestly such a questionnaire?

"Compare it with fraud in the social security or tax evasion. There you can pretty well do research , if you can ensure that people remain anonymous. There are also earlier surveys among scientists : two percent indicate serious fraud , and about 34 percent have ever searched the gray area. But that will be an underestimate. "

### How will you ensure that researchers feel secure enough to answer honestly ?

" There, you can use all kinds of methods . A very nice way the randomized response . For example, you ask people whether they have ever committed fraud , but before she answers they need to toss a coin . If it's heads, they 're answer yes . If the coin is , they have to fill honest yes or no. The beauty is that at least half of all respondents say yes : you just do not know which of them is actually a fraud. But then fill more than half yes , you can still calculate how often fraud. "

### How would you improve the research practice ?

"There has been surprisingly little research , but it plays to me on three levels. The problem is in the man himself, with his personality , upbringing and beliefs. But it also is in the research culture : it is normal to check each other a bit and talk to mistakes? Can you talk together about your dilemmas? And finally you have the system of science itself , with hyper competition and the silly obsession with the number of citations per article that puts a lot of pressure on scientists. If we get more insight into the research practice , we can also improve. "
