This website is maintained by Sau-Chin Chen. I build this website and blog by jekyll and R because I used to use R in my research and teaching. I am the assistant professor of [Department of Humand Development and Psychology, Tzu-Chi University](http://www.hdd.tcu.edu.tw/) since 2009. Between 2016 Feb and 2017 Jan, I am visiting [Department of Psychology, Erasmus University Rotterdam](http://www.eur.nl/fsw/english/psychology/). Durning this period, I am collaborating with [Rolf Zwaan](http://rolfzwaan.blogspot.nl/) on the mental simulation in language comprehension. You will find the articles and blog posts about my research that are going to be updated.  
  
This website is under development with the growth of my knowledge about [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). At the time I had completed a project, the workout will be available in [Github](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). If you want to know how this website is built, check [CONSTRUCTION](http://scchen.com/construction/). I would like to contribute my experience to who are going to use the toolkits of data science to improve the quality of work and life.
